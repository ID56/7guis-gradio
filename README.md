Gradio (Python) implementaion of [The 7 GUIs Benchmark](https://7guis.github.io/7guis/)

I recently came across the 7 GUIs benchmark, and was surprised to see that none [of the implementations](https://eugenkiss.github.io/7guis/implementations) were written in Python (whereas many other backend and frontend languages had implementations). This is probably due to the frustrations involved in building GUIs with Python, a problem that Gradio is designed to help with.

So in this repo, I decided to create the Python implementations for the 7 GUIs (work in progress).
